# ScoreboardManager
This project is an example of n-tier architecture based on C#, ASP.Net Web Forms. For the sake of smiplicity, I haven't use any security feature in this project, so please implement your own security technologies. Moreover, I haven't use any modern UI and caching technologies for the same as well.

If you need any help, you can reach me through LinkedIn, I will try to answer your queries. 


You will get necessary script for SQL tables, procedures and some default data under ScoreboardManager.Documents\SQL folder.

Note: If you download this project, you can miss roslyn folder in ScoreboardManager.WebForms\bin. Please add the folder and necessary DLLs under it. If you create a ASP.Net Web Forms project in Visual Studio, you will get the folder and necessary DLLs under it. Just copy and paste!
